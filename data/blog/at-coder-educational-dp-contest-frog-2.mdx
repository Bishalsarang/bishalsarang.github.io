### [](https://www.blogger.com/null)Problem Statement

There are `N` stones, numbered `1,2,…,N.` For each `i (1≤i≤N)` the height of Stone `i` is `h`  
There is a frog who is initially on Stone 1. He will repeat the following action some number of times to reach Stone `N`:  
If the frog is currently on Stone i jump to one of the following: Stone `i+1,i+2,…,i+K.` Here, a cost of |hi−hj| is incurred, where j is the stone to land on.  
Find the minimum possible total cost incurred before the frog reaches Stone N.

-------------------------------------------

*   All values in input are integers.
*   `2 ≤ N ≤ 105`
*   `1 ≤ K ≤ 100`
*   `1 ≤ hi ≤ 104`

### [](https://www.blogger.com/null)Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:  
N K  
h1 h2 … hN  

[](https://www.blogger.com/null)Output
--------------------------------------

Print the minimum possible total cost incurred.  
5 3  
10 30 40 50 20  
  
Sample Output 1  
30  
If we follow the path `11 → 22 → 55`, the total cost incurred would be `|10−30|+|30−20|=30.`

---------------------------------------------

This problem is similar to [Frog A](https://sarangbishal.blogspot.com/) . The only difference is that if the frog is at ith stone, it can jump upto k stones from the current stone.  
Let’s say the frog is currently at i = 0 stones and k = 3, in one hop it can jump to one of the {1, 2, 3} stone.  
The task is to find the minimum cost to reach (n - 1)th stone (0 based indexing as I find it easier)  
Make an array dp\[n\] and initialize with infinite distance.Here, dp\[i\] gives the cost to reach ith stone. So,  

```cpp
dp[0] = 0;
dp[1] = abs(h[1] - h[0]) 
```
For every other stones `2 <= i < n`, the frog can jump from from the stone before it, as long as the distance is less than or equal to `k.`  
```cpp
for(int j = i - 1, jump = 0; j >= 0 && jump < k; j--, jump++){
     dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[j] + abs(h[j] - h[i]));
} 
```

-----------------------------------------------

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
 
using namespace std;
 
int main(){
    int n, k; cin >> n >> k;
    vector<int> h(n);
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
        cin >> h[i];
    }
    
    //dp[i] denotes the minimum cost to reach ith stone
    // 0 < i < n - 1 are the stones
    //We are asked to dind the cost to reach last stone i.e dp[n - 1]
    //Initially there is infinite cost to reach ith stones
    vector<int> dp(n, INT_MAX);
  
    //To reach first stone there is no cost. SO dp[0] = 0
    dp[0] = 0;
   //To reach second stone the frog can jump from 0th stone costing dp[1] = abs(h[1] - h[0])
    dp[1] = abs(h[1] - h[0]);
    
    //For every other stones 2 <= i < n, the frog can jump from the (i - 1), (i - 2)...(i - k)th stones 
    for(int i = 2; i < n; i++){
      for(int j = i - 1, jump = 0; j  >= 0 && jump < k; j--, jump++){
        dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[j] + abs(h[j] - h[i]));
      }
    }
    //Print minm cost to reach (n - 1)th stone
    cout << dp[n - 1];
    return 0;
} 
```
