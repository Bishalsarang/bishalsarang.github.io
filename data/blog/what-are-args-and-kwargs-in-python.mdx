In this post, I'm going to talk about \*args and \*\*kwargs in Python which is a useful concept while handling multiple arguments.



They are called `*args` and `**kwargs` in Python which allows the function to accept optional arguments(`positional` and `keyword`).
Let’s see with an example.
At first, let’s make a simple function that accepts a single argument, `first_name`.
```
>>> def person(first_name):
...     print(first_name)
>>> person("Ram")
Ram
>>> person()
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: person() missing 1 required positional argument: 'first_name'
```
What we can see is `first_name` is a compulsory argument. So, it is not possible to call the function without arguments.
Now, what we are going to do is make a function that accepts `first_name` as compulsory arguments followed by `last_name` as an optional argument.
One way to do this would be
```
>>> def person(first_name, last_name=""):
...     print(first_name, last_name)
>>> person("Ram") # Called with 1 argument
Ram
>>> person("Ram", "Shrestha") # Called with 2 arguments
Ram Shrestha
```
So far everything is going well. But now we want to scale the same function to accept `first_name`(compulsory) and `last_name` and `middle_name` as positional arguments.
One simple trick is to add another argument middle\_name.
```
>>> def person(first_name, last_name="", middle_name=""):
...     print(first_name, middle_name, last_name)
```
But there is a more concise way to scale the function to accept multiple optional arguments called `*args` in Python.

> \*args collects extra positional arguments as a tuple

The idea is simple. We modify our function definition as:
```
>>> def person(first_name, *args):
...     print(first_name, end = " ")
...     for names in reversed(args):
...             print(names, end=" ")
...     print()
>>> # Accepts single argument
>>> person("Ram")
Ram
>>> # Accepts 2 arguments
>>> person("Ram", "Chhetri")
Ram Chhetri
>>> # Accepts 3 arguments
>>> person("Ram", "Chhetri", "Lal")
Ram Lal Chhetri
>>> person("Ram", "Chhetri", "Lal", "Krishna")
Ram Krishna Lal Chhetri
```
We can see that now our function can accept `first_name` followed by `last_name`, `middle_name` as optional positional arguments. To see if `args` is indeed a tuple you can add
```
print(type(args))
```
inside of function definition
Let’s see another example:

**_Task 1: Write a function to add N integers which are passed as arguments ( N >= 1)_**
Let’s do it for 1 integer
```
>>> def add(a):
...     return a
>>> add(8)
8
```
Nothing complicated. Now do it for 2 integers
```
>>> def add(a, b):
...     return a + b
>>> add(8, 2)
10
>>> add(8)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: add() missing 1 required positional argument: 'b'
```
Notice?? We lost the compatibility for 1 argument.
This is where `*args` comes handy:
```
>>> def add(a, *args):
...     sum = a
...     print(type(args))
...     for num in args:
...         sum += num
...     return sum
>>> add(8)
8
>> add(8, 2)
10
>> add(8, 2, 5)
15
```
See how flexible it is using `*args`. Note it is not necessary to name `*arg`s as `args` . We can name it whatever we like. But it must be preceded with a `*`.

--------------------------------------------------

> \*\*kwargs collects extra positional arguments as a dictionary.

Let’s return to our previous examples of function `person`:

**_Task 2: Modify function person so that it accepts additional optional parameters phone\_num, email and so on…as keywords._**
We modify our original function definition to accept a new argument `**kwargs` which is a keyword argument as:
```
>>> def person(first_name, *args, **kwargs):
...     print(first_name, end=" ")
...     for names in reversed(args):
...             print(names, end=" ")
...     print()
...     # Since kwargs is a dictionary
...     # we can iterate using .items()
...     for key, value in kwargs.items():
...             print(key, value)
>>> person("Ram", "Chhetri", "Lal", phone_num="981128331", email="anon@testmail.com")

Ram Lal Chhetri
phone_num 981128331
email anon@testmail.com
```
Since kwargs is of dictionary type. we can iterate over key, value using `.items()`
**_Notes:_**

*   `*args` and `**kwargs` are used to allow the function to accept a variable number of arguments
*   `*args` collects positional arguments as a tuple whereas `**kwargs` as dictionary
*   `args` and `kwargs` are just naming convention. You can name it whatever you like.
*   `*` and `**` are also used in value unpacking
