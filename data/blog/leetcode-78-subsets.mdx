In this post, I'm going to talk about a problem on leetcode which asks us to find all the possible subsets of given list of integers. This problem is the base to solving other problems like subset sum and subset partitioning which I'll be discussing in coming posts. Let's get started: I'll be solving this problem using 2 techniques:

1.  Using Recursion
2.  Using Bitset

I'll be using cpp for this task.
**Problem Statement:** Given a set of distinct integers, nums, return all possible subsets (the power set).
**Note**: The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets.
Example: Input:
```
nums = [1,2,3]
```
Output:
```
[
  [3],
  [1],
  [2],
  [1,2,3],
  [1,3],
  [2,3],
  [1,2],
  []
]
```

Solution
--------

### 1\. Using Recursion

Firstly, I'll be discussing recursive approach to subset finding problem. Recursive problem is easy to visualise. Consider the given testcase `[1, 2, 3]`.

Let `solve(nums, n, subset)` be the function that find subsets for array `nums` and number of elements `n`, initially called with an empty `subset`. So our initial call is :
```cpp
vector<int>subset;
solve(nums, nums.size(), subset);
```

Now lets try visualising how recursion tree looks like.
**Recursive Cases:** For every state i.e `(n),` i,e position `n - 1` of
```cpp
solve(nums, n, subset)
```

we can have 2 choices:(_Try to visualise recursion for arr = {1, 2, 3} )_

*   Don’t include the current element in the subset i.e simply call
```cpp
solve(nums, n - 1, subset);
```

*   Include current element in the subset
```cpp
subset.push_back(arr[n -  1]);
solve(nums, n -  1, subset);
```

**Base Cases:**
Let’s think of base cases. The base cases are:

*   If `n == 0` i.e no item left push the current `subset` to our `subsets_` which is a vector of vector.
```cpp
if (n == 0){
    subsets_.push_back(subset);
    return;
}
    ```

**Complete Code:**
```cpp
class Solution {
    public:
    // Vector of vector of int to store all the subsets
    vector<vector<int>> subsets_;

    // Solve method that generates subset recursively
    void solve(vector<int> &nums, int n, vector<int> subset){
        // If size of array becomes 0, no elemnts are left
        // We push current subset to our subsets_ and return
        if (n == 0){
            subsets_.push_back(subset);
            return;
        }
        // Else we have 2 options:

        // Don't include the current element to subset
        solve(nums, n - 1, subset);
        // Incldue the current element in subset
        subset.push_back(nums[n - 1]);
        solve(nums, n - 1, subset);
}

    // Solution method subsets
    vector<vector<int>> subsets(vector<int>& nums) {
        // Make an empty vector subset
        vector<int> subset;
        // Call solve function initially with an empty subset
        solve(nums, nums.size(), subset);
        // Return subsets after calculation
        return subsets_;
    }
};
    ```

### 2\. Using Bitset
